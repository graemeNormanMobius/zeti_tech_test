# Zeti technical test

### Running the APP:
- install packages :: (```npm install``` || ```yarn install```)
- start json-server API :: (```npm run api``` || ```yarn run api```)
- start app :: (```npm run start``` || ```yarn run start```)
- login to the app :: u: graemeTest@testmail.com || p: password123 (users with login details can be found in /data/db.json)
- execute tests :: (```npm run test``` || ```yarn run test```)

### What included (packages):
- React v18
- Jest
- Typescript
- AG-Grid
- ReactPDF
- CSS grid
- React Bootstrap
- JSON Server
- MapBox
- Custom components (built by me in my current role at MobiusCarbon)

### Functionality:
- JSON server to mimic Azure API provided (provided me with more flexibility to create a demo with the limited data provided)
- Login with user authentication and cookie storage for logged-in user (can add other users if you want in the DB.json)
    - There are two logins. One with 2 vehicles and the other with 1 vehicle (you can login with either login to view)
- Theme switcher for light / dark mode
- Custom components built on-top of React-Bootstrap for flexibility (some of these were taken from the APP at Mobius Carbon where I've been working - everything is 100% created by me being the sole Frontend Engineer who worked there)
- Generate and download invoice for Feb 2021
- Ability to Add new cars to fleet through APP (just through a single button click, if I had more time I'd have created a new car form in the modal)
- Responsive layout for desktop / tablet / mobile
- Mapbox map on dashboard which shows:
    - blue plots for last 10 jobs in the fleet
    - single red plot for company base location
- Tests for most the functionality in utils file (this is where most of the calculations / data manipulation was done that's why I chose that file)
- Utils file created for main functionality allowing reusability throughout the app
- Theme setup using CSS variables and a toggleable className in the DOM making adding additional themes for different clients / different levels of usability extremely easy

### Presumptions:
- I've presumed for the purpose of the demo that "today's date" is 28th February 2021
- I've extended the API data to allow for more functionality to be added in the APP demo.
    - The initial response is as it was still I've just enhanced it by adding more properties and values to it to allow me to build the app without using static dummy data
- When enhancing the data I've presumed that the taxi base location is here: 264 Long Riding, Basildon SS14 1RS (purely because when I did a GoogleMap search for "Bob's taxi" there used to be a Bob's cab in Basildon at that location!)
- I've made a presumption that vehicle with licence plate "CBDH 789" isn't part of Bob's Taxi's fleet as it wasn't mentioned that it was on the brief (I have added vehicle "CBDH 789" to the APP but under the another login I created which can be viewed separately).
  As a result I've enhanced the vehicle object to return a new property clientId as a way of identifying and filtering vehicles by their respected client.
  The same clientId has also been added to the user object so we know which client the user is part of.
  In a real world situation I would recommend the clientId be auto generated as a UUID4 to ensure uniqueness for scalability (for the purpose of this demo I've generated the UUIDs manually).

### What have I used AI for:
- Parts of the initial bootstrapping of the APP (tsconfig / jest.config)
- A couple of Vite setup bits (as some of the Vite config setup is quite specific)
- Mapbox GL (never used it before, done a lot of development with GoogleMaps in the past but always wanted to have a play with Mapbox).
    - Some of the code for generating markers was generated by AI as the initial tutorial on Mapbox website wasn't working as intended

### If I have more time:
- I'd have added more tests
- Functionality wise I would have liked to have added:
    - a proper form for the "Add Vehicle" modal
    - filtering of vehicles on the "yourFleet" page
    - added a "Carbon saved" calculation and indicator which shows compared to an average petrol / diesel car how much carbon has been saved for the miles driven per month
    - a fake payment screen to be able to pay the invoice and see a new row added with "PAID" status to the billing table
    - added daily completed jobs for vehicles for the whole month, this would have allowed us to:
      - create charts to show different metrics (would have used HighCharts for this due to its extensive config and flexibility)
    - implement proper API backend with separate DB (json-server is good and gives some good functionality but is a little limiting with having to have a flat file structure as it's essentially just a JSON file)

### Final notes:
- Please can I ask that my ```MAPBOX_API_KEY``` isn't re-used outside of this demo as it is linked to a paid account in my name!
